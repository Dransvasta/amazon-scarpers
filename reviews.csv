0,Yasaman Z.,Must Read this Review ( its very brief for the people without much time),5.0,"
I LOVED this Xbox series S as both an upgrade and as console as a whole. Some people state that the gift card isn't included in the purchase but it appears available in the setup process ( keep in mind you need a payment method since its a ""free trial"") . The storage it contains is sufficient and can easily support expansion storage hard drives if needed. The setup was straightforward and quick ( probably totaling just under 10 minutes in total). The graphic quality is pretty good for the price you pay and definitely a cheaper, but fairly similar in terms of quality , alternative to the more expensive PS5. Overall, this Xbox was a pretty good purchase and would definitely recommend other people to buy if you're  in the console market.

1,Sheila O'Rourke,"Very Good, I like video games",5.0,"
I got the Xbox series S and it is very good. I never understand why they always say 500 gb cause when I turn it on every time it is more like 360 gb of free space and I do not understand where the extra gb was used for maybe it used for hard

2,B Perry,100/10,5.0,"
I got this as an upgrade for my switch and wow it is so much better. I got it for 225$ sale so if you wan t to buy make sure it‚Äôs on sale.Pros:Cheapest next gen consoleGreat graphics and performance on most gamesQuick resume: you don‚Äôt have to reboot up your game if you stop playingGamepass some amazing games on there.ConsStorage is only abt 400gb and expansions very costlyOnly digital so no getting gmaes from your friends or buying/renting used oneMy favorite games are WRC ea sports (rally racing game )and no man‚Äôs sky(sci-fi space exploration game)

Now granted, I don't have a smart 4k state of the art tv, but for the price I got for the brand, I'm satisfied with how games looked on it. This was before playing on the Series S. The games, streaming services, even YouTube looks amazing through the system. Yes, it would be nice to have a Series X for the disc. But I'm really impressed with this little console that could. Not only does it run amazing, the quick resume feature blows my mind everytime I switch from YouTube to a game. I think I'm more impressed with just how quiet this thing is. My former main console was a PS4 Pro. And oh boy, it was like a plane was taking off everytime it need to load. If you have the money for a Series X, I'd say go for it; especially if you can find a sale going for it. But if you don't care for the disc drive or the extra power, you won't be disappointed with the Series S. With this and Game Pass, I'm set for life!

4,Leb,Amazing value,5.0,"
I bought this as a Christmas present for my little brother and he loves it! Way more powerful than the previous generation of Xbox and way faster too. We were both surprised as to how small the console was. Since the older generation of Xbox is slowly losing support for newer games, he had to upgrade and the series s is a fantastic bang for your buck.

5,Amazon Shopper,Amazing! Just one problem‚Ä¶,4.0,"

6,Toney,It‚Äôs a Xboxü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5.0,"
‚ÄúAfter 3 weeks of waiting for amazon to ship it‚ÄùI‚Äôm not a big gamer but do like to play if I find a good game, so I had the one X but can‚Äôt play new games so was forced to buy this. Graphics look the same as the Xbox one X so not much to say in a review and my game pass was included when I hooked up my system so no problems there. And yes out of the 500g memory you start off with 25% used. I downloaded 3 games and still have 40% so all good there.

27,Bob,"Yes, folks, it DOES include GAME PASS ULTIMATE for 3 months.",5.0,"
Smaller, more compact than it's rival (see photo). Great little gaming console. Arrived today as an early Christmas present for my son. So many reviews complain about the 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate not being in the box....Folks, actually set up and try your products before reviewing them please! When you complete the setup with the XBox app on your phone (as the console prompts you to do when it is turned on), it walks you through the steps to complete the console setup....but wait, there's more! It also....  ::shocker:: ....lets you sign up for the free three months of Game Pass Ultimate.So, instead of a knee-jerk reaction to poor marketing (i.e. - the appearance of an actual ""product"" representing the 3-month pass in the product imaging), actually set some stuff up before you run to the internet to complain?

¬†Waited a whole 3 weeks to open it up. When i did the UPS and original xbox packaging were busted up. I opened it up and did the initial setup and after, there was no audio output. The xbox would then turn off and on repeatedly. The resolution was also all distorted. I tried multiple times changing HDMI cords and trying to change audio output settings on both the xbox and tv but no luck. I even plugged in my original xbox one and it still had audio and the same tv, hdmi everything. I will be returning and maybe trying again? Super sad and disappointed :( And yes, i made sure my tv wasnt muted üòÇ
"
44,Nick,"Shipped without any additional packaging, memory is pathetic.",1.0,"
This was a Christmas present and it was shipped in the Xbox box, no external packaging, no bubble wrap or air packs, just a packing slip slapped on the same packaging you'd have if you bought this at a store. 500GB also filled up almost Immediately, three games and the memories almost full. Yeah I could've got the 1TB version but then they'd still only be able to get about 7 games on it. These massive games with constant updates are getting ridiculous and as long as we keep buying they'll keep doing it.
"
45,S. B.,Game Pass Doesn‚Äôt work and only 360gb,1.0,"
Game pass was already redeemed so we do not have the 3 month unlimited subscription as advertised. At no point during the set up was I prompted to set up the game pass. After calling both xbox and amazon multiple times there was no resolution or explanation other than we were scammed by the seller and the 3 month offer had already been redeemed by someone else or was never valid.Also its advertised its a 512gb system but it‚Äôs actually about 360gb after the operating system updates.Supposed to be a special gift from santa has now turned into a headache.

My son was so excited to receive his Xbox for Christmas and after he got it all set up and logged in, we noticed that he never received the 3-month game pass that was supposed to be included. VERY DISAPPOINTED! How do I go about getting the game pass sent to me that should have arrived with our purchase??

I got this for my son for Christmas but when using this the power supply didn‚Äôt work or something and would just shut off.

"
51,Jenna Kennedy,Great purchase and I ended up buying 2,5.0,"
I was new to gaming and didn‚Äôt want to spend a fortune in case I didn‚Äôt like it.  It‚Äôs been amazing.  I did have to add the seagate expansion 1TB card due to most new games like COD and Starfield taking up so much space.  Even so, I stream directly to twitch from my Xbox and there aren‚Äôt any delays or issues even though I‚Äôm in a small town without prime internet speeds.  For non optimized games you can add an external hard drive, which I also have.  Xbox is the way to go from the research I have been doing.  This current deal is too good to pass up, especially when it‚Äôs plug and play with 3 months of game pass.
"
52,Grace Hilal Pioneer,Amazing deal and console,5.0,"
The fact that a ps5 is 600$ and this bundle is only 240$ with 3 months of game pass is amazing, Xbox is so much better then play station and Microsoft is the best thing in the world, use Bing not google, use Xbox not play station, plus Microsoft rewards, what else can you ask for?

"
55,Conner Anger,waste of money keep ur xbox one or get the series x,1.0,"
it has all the same issues as the xbox one, less storage then the higher models. i have issues with frames with games running with quick resume the latency is pretty much the same regardless of where i play it. when powered off there a 50/50 chance that when you turn it on it it will refuse to connect to the internet or your controller will refuse to connect, the only way to solve this is unplugging a replugging back in. save your money buy the ps5 or ps4 honestly so much better as long as you get a good controller.
"
56,Matt V.,Do not get for your kids,1.0,"
This system is the absolute worst! You have to sign up for all kinds of different accounts and websites just to play different games. The console never connects to your internet. On average, it takes 30 minutes to get your kid into a game when you first turn it on. I highly recommend a system that you insert the game disc and play right away without jumping through all these hoops just to play a game.
"
57,HbEoLyL,Good,1.0,"
Microsoft had always been know to scam but let me make it easy you won‚Äôt have storage for anything. Nowadays games are 100-150gbs per game that‚Äôs not even including updates and add ons so with the 512gb storage limits you to like 3 games it‚Äôs so dumb now that you don‚Äôt have any more space and you want more games they make you get this over prices internal storage expansion which is 150-200$ so at the end of the day your gonna end up paying the price is a series x either way so please read this cause it‚Äôll save you headache just get the series x

Great for gaming but storage place is incredibly low.
",4.0,"
Storage space is only 360 gigabytes. In today‚Äôs day and age is disgustingly low because games are getting bigger and bigger. Other than that it‚Äôs great, for me this is just temporary until k upgrade to a pc, if you‚Äôre a casual gamer and only play a few games this is perfect for you. Graphics are good and games in 60fps is awesome, load times are great.It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre more ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù and play a lot but you‚Äôll have to shuffle games around a lot but if you want a lot of space, better graphics, and potentially higher fps I‚Äôd recommend getting the series x.

I like everything about the systemThe price was decent and I used affirm pay in installments only thing I didn't like about this purchase is it took about a week to recieve it you would hope and think when spending 500 on something that you would get a next day option for delivery and intercom delivery just left it on my deck a foot from the side walk with no notification it was delivered and no knock on the door no signing for the package like it was suppose to 500 could of been gone just like that very irresponsible of the delivery service that's who was chosen to deliver based on options of when to recieve it

Xbox console is great the new game pass is a deal breaker
",4.0,"
I love the Xbox series S so far Ive owned every generation since the first one dropped way way back in fact Ive bought 2 of most to game with my son. The Series S was a temp until I got the Series X  as it has some limitations that bother me in not being able to play the library of games I already own in hard copy.  Im very impressed with the console it has all you need and more in features but is a little lacking in storage and no hard drive no HDMI in for chromecast or firestick none of which are deal breakers for me personally.The downside is not the console but the path Xbox has chosen with its online play getting rid of the Live Gold plans and switched you to the Game Pass Ultimate  the only thing ultimate is the cost.  its insane and all the great prices the free games and deals sales etc are all GONE  I used really push the Xbox for how it treated its supporters (clients, customers) as it was SO much better than Sony and how they charged you insane prices for games  Xbox kept things reasonable  even great and you came back and back bought more newest consoles controllers accessories and so on.  You can no longer use that as a selling point to switch people from Sony PS5 to XboxThis will be my last Xbox console not because of the console but the service and online play its just gotten too greedy

J'adore vraiment cette s√©rie S ! La seule console sur le march√©, en ce moment, √† offrir les jeux next gen pour beaucoup moins ch√®re!Certe la s√©rie S est moins puissante que la s√©rie X ou encore que la PS5, mais elle vous permettra de jouer au exclusivit√© de Microsoft sur la derni√®re g√©n√©ration de console en plus d'√™tre r√©tro compatible avec les jeux de Xbox original et de Xbox 360. Pour moi qui ne cherchais pas a tout prix √† avoir des graphismes aussi beau que pourrait offrir les autres consoles celle-ci me convient parfaitement (si vous cherchez des beaux graphismes achetez donc un PC).L'interface est fluide et la prise en main tr√®s rapide. Une fois le compte Microsoft configur√© a la console vous serez en mesure d'activer l'abonnement au gamepass d'une dur√©e de 3 mois gratuitement.Je retire une √©toile car le stockage est vraiment limit√© et vous devrez √† coup s√ªr acheter de l'espace de stockage dans le futur, surtout si vous aimez tester/jouer a plusieurs jeux.

Good for playing new X/s only games but lacks storage. Only really worth it if you play a handful of games, I only have storage for 4-5 games, 2 of which are kind of large files. Anything more and you have to pay another $100 or so for extra storage. If that's the case just hold out and get the X
